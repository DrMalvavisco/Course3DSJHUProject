# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repository is my submission for the peer-graded assesment for the project in the Cleaning and Getting data of the DS JHU Specialization of Coursera.  
We followed the 5 steps specified in the project's definition:  
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
